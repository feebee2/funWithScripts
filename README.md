# funWithScripts


fun test project for Code Lou

running main.sh will create a directory+bash script which will then be executed to create an html file

I recommend playing around with this in replit 

I left the name of my replit project the same in the files but you will need to change that part of the filepath to your own replit project or rename your replit project to match for it to work there

comments in the code should explain individual steps
